SurfComp

Overall Description:

SurfComp is a website for surfers to quickly find info on their favorite beaches and the conditions there. It also offers a social platform component to allow users to create an account and personalize their profile.

The openWeather Api is used to get current weather information including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and overall conditions description on two seperate pages. On the home page, multiple locations are pulled simultaneously using a loop.

Jquery is used both in the capacity for AJAX, in getting data about locations and asynchronously updating the locations page, and for animation/effects, as well as for the scroll effect that makes the navbar easier to see.

The site also features a photo upload and display system. Users can upload both a profile picture and background image for their profile.
